    <h1>Jubilee Sounds</h1>
    <p>
        On the morning of October 17, 2014, I woke up with a clear and unmistakable message: 
        “It is time for you to record your music.” I knew instantly that this was the voice of God. 
        My response, however, was simple: “What music?” I had no music to record, or so I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, I heard the Lord say: “You will record 7 instrumentals, each 7 minutes long, to prepare My people for their Jubilee.” 
        The call was clear: I had been commissioned by God to create these seven pieces of music. The urgency and significance of the task overwhelmed me, and it felt as though failure wasn’t an option. I sensed that this music was already written in heaven, and my role was simply to receive it and bring it to life.
    </p>
    <p>
        At that time, I knew little about the concept of Jubilee beyond what I had read in the book of Leviticus. 
        Why would God call me to create music tied to this ancient tradition? Despite my limited understanding, I felt a profound sense of divine purpose in the request. 
        It was as if this assignment was connected to something far greater than I could fully grasp at the moment. The urgency of the message only deepened my sense of calling.
    </p>
    <p>
        From this encounter, two significant things came to pass:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>The Creation of the Jubilee Sounds Soundtrack:</strong> 
            I obeyed the call and created a CD featuring 7 instrumental tracks, each 7 minutes long. This project not only fulfilled God’s command but also received recognition, being nominated for Instrumental of the Year at the GMA (Gospel Music Association) of Canada.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A Revelation of the Modern-Day Jubilee:</strong> 
            This divine encounter sparked a deeper revelation about the significance of Jubilee in today’s world. 
            I came to understand that this call wasn’t just about creating music—it was part of a broader, prophetic message leading to the restoration of the earth to its original, God-intended purpose.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>The Purpose of This Website:</strong> 
        The purpose of this website is to share the revelations that emerged from this profound encounter with the Lord. 
        Through music, reflection, and understanding, I invite you to join me on this journey of restoration and explore how modern-day Jubilees are unfolding in our time and how we can participate in them.
