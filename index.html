<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Jubilee Sounds</b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>On the morning of October 17, 2014, I woke up with a clear
and unmistakable message: &quot;It is time for you to record your music.&quot;
I knew instantly that this was the voice of God. My response, however, was
simple: &quot;What music&quot;? I had no music to record, or so I thought.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>Then, I heard the Lord say: &quot;You will record 7
instrumentals, each 7 minutes long, to prepare My people for their
Jubilee.&quot; The call was clear: I had been commissioned by God to create
these seven pieces of music. The urgency and significance of the task
overwhelmed me, and it felt as though failure wasn't an option. I sensed that
this music was already written in heaven, and my role was simply to receive it
and bring it to life.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>At that time, I knew little about the concept of Jubilee
beyond what I had read in the book of Leviticus. Why would God call me to
create music tied to this ancient tradition&quot; Despite my limited
understanding, I felt a profound sense of divine purpose in the request. It
seemed as though this assignment was connected to something far greater than I
could fully grasp at that moment. The urgency of the message only deepened my
sense of calling.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>From this encounter, two significant things came to pass:</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>1. <b>The Creation of the Jubilee Sounds Soundtrack</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I obeyed the call and created a CD featuring 7 instrumental
tracks, each 7 minutes long. This project not only fulfilled God's command but
also received recognition, being nominated for Instrumental of the Year at the
Gospel Music Association (GMA) of Canada.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>2. <b>A Revelation of the Modern-Day Jubilee</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This divine encounter sparked a deeper revelation about the
significance of Jubilee in today's world. I came to understand that this call
wasn't just about creating music. It was part of a broader, prophetic message
leading to the restoration of the earth to its original, God-intended purpose.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Purpose of This Website</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The purpose of this website is to share the revelations that
emerged from this profound encounter with the Lord. Through music, reflection,
and understanding, I invite you to join me on this journey of restoration and
explore how modern-day Jubilees are unfolding in our time and how we can
participate in them.</p>
