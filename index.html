<h2>Jubilee Sounds</h2>

<p>On the morning of October 17, 2014, I woke up with a clear and unmistakable message: "It is time for you to record your music." I knew instantly that this was the voice of God. My response, however, was simple: "What music?" I had no music to record, or so I thought.
 </p>

<p> Then, I heard the Lord say: "You will record 7 instrumentals, each 7 minutes long, to prepare My people for their Jubilee." The call was clear: I had been commissioned by God to create these seven pieces of music. The urgency and significance of the task overwhelmed me, and it felt as though failure wasn't an option. I sensed that this music was already written in heaven, and my role was simply to receive it and bring it to life.
</p>

<p>At that time, I knew little about the concept of Jubilee beyond what I had read in the book of Leviticus.

<p>From this encounter, two significant things came to pass:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Creation of the Jubilee Sounds Soundtrack</strong>
        <p>I obeyed the call and created a CD featuring 7 instrumental tracks, each 7 minutes long. This project not only fulfilled God's command but also received recognition, being nominated for Instrumental of the Year at the Gospel Music Association (GMA) of Canada.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>A Revelation of the Modern-Day Jubilee</strong>
        <p>This divine encounter sparked a deeper revelation about the significance of Jubilee in today's world. I came to understand that this call wasn't just about creating music. It was part of a broader, prophetic message leading to the restoration of the earth to its original, God-intended purpose.</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of this website</strong> </p>
<p>The purpose of this website is to share the revelations that emerged from this profound encounter with the Lord. Through music, reflection, and understanding, I invite you to join me on this journey of restoration and explore how modern-day Jubilees are unfolding in our time and how we can participate in them.
