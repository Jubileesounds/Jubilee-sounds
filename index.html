<h2>Jubilee Sounds</h2>
<br>
<p>On the morning of October 17, 2014, I woke up with a clear and unmistakable message: "It is time for you to record your music." I knew instantly that this was the voice of God. My response, however, was simple: "What music?" I had no music to record, or so I thought.
 </p>

<p> Then, I heard the Lord say: "You will record 7 instrumentals, each 7 minutes long, to prepare My people for their Jubilee." The call was clear: I had been commissioned by God to create these seven pieces of music. The urgency and significance of the task overwhelmed me, and it felt as though failure wasn't an option. I sensed that this music was already written in heaven, and my role was simply to receive it and bring it to life.

<br>
<p>At that time, I knew little about the concept of Jubilee beyond what I had read in the book of Leviticus. Why would God call me to create music tied to this ancient tradition" Despite my limited understanding, I felt a profound sense of divine purpose in the request. It seemed as though this assignment was connected to something far greater than I could fully grasp at that moment. The urgency of the message only deepened my sense of calling.

<p>From this encounter, two significant things came to pass:
